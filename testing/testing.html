                <p>Hello! Welcome to Mickey's Music. This is a website run by me (Meekyle, yes that is me on the left), where I talk about the music that I listen to and my thoughts on them. I like coding, and listening to music, so what better way is there to combine the two than to create a website for my music takes. I am by no means an expert in music, quite frankly, I don't know what I'm talking about for the most part. SO, if you don't agree with any of my takes, all power to ya, it's an opinion at the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with them being different.

                    If you want to reach me, be it for suggesting an album I should check out, or for any other inquiries, please direct them to ammrmondal@gmail.com</p>
