                <p>Hello! Welcome to <strong>Meekyle's Music</strong>. This is a website run by me (Meekyle Mondal), where I talk about the music that I listen to 
                    and my thoughts on them. I like coding, and listening to music, so what better way is there to combine the two than to create a 
                    website for my music takes. I am by no means an expert in music, quite frankly, I don't know what I'm talking about for the most 
                    part. <strong>SO, if you don't agree with any of my takes, all power to ya, it's an opinion at the end of the day, there's nothing wrong 
                    with them being different.</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    If you want to reach me, be it for suggesting an album I should check out, or for any other inquiries, please direct them to 
                    <strong>meekylemondal123@gmail.com</strong>
